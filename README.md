# NGSSets
A JAVA API aimed to manage genomic datasets (Bed, VCF, FASTA, FASTQ, BAM/SAM). You can do many common tasks in genomic with only one API.

### DNA sequence datasets
This is de most common datasets in Genomics, represented by FASTA format. It consists of a String characters (that represents a DNA sequence) and an ID. With this API you can import and export FASTA files, renames the IDs, remove and sequences, etc.

### Sequencing datasets
Next generation sequencing (NGS) is one of the most widely used technologies in genomics. The format used in NGS data is FASTQ, a variation of FASTA, that include some extra information about the sequencing process. With NGSSets you can perform several operations, such as, import and export FASTQ files, downsampling, remove and add entries, etc.

### Genomic coordinates datasets

### SNPs datasets

### Alignment datasets

### How to add NGSSets to my JAVA project?

### Where can I find some examples about its usage?
